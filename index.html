      <p>
        Computer Scientist, Mathematician, and Software Engineer interested in
        Machine Learning and pushing the boundaries of understanding in Computer
        Science. I am still exploring the fields, but I find the intersection of
        Computer Science and Mathematics to be facinating. My current research
        interests lie in solidying the theoretical underpinnings of neural
        networks. I currently work as a Data Scientist & Software Engineer at
        Hinalea Imaging working with sensing on hyperspectral imagery.

          I currently work as a Software & Machine Learning Engineer at HinaLea
          Imaging, a TruTag Technologies subsidiary focused on the development
          of hyperspectral imaging and sensing. I lead the effort into
          developing state-of-the-art hyperspectral machine learning algorithms
          for sensing on our HYSI data.

            Designed and developed deep learning-based macroscopic bacterial
            segmentation network for hyperspectral images.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and developed Siamese network-based object tracking and
            homography deep networks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Employed self-supervised pretraining to improve generalization power
            of models in low-data environments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed deep regression network for predicting fruit acidity,
            firmness, and shelf-life from a hyperspectral image.

          Researching the mathematical aspects of theoretical machine learning
          under Professor Shuyang Ling of NYU Shanghai. Currently focusing on
          graph embedding, sparsification, and coarsening, the goal of which is
          to allow large-scale graph networks to be computed on with a greatly
          reduced computational footprint and minimal deviations from
          computations on the original.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conducted research under Professor Ling for a senior thesis in finding
          edge cases (both good and bad!) of popular dimensional reduction and
          visualization techniques, such as t-SNE, all of which were implemented
          in PyTorch and Numpy.

          Researched emerging post-quantum, lattice-based cryptography schemes
          under the guidance of Professor Siyao Guo of NYU Shanghai, as well as
          delved into the inner workings of quantum computing theory. The goal
          of the research was to investigate some of the many open questions in
          post-quantum cryptography and work towards answering them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gained experience in writing proofs for proving the security of
          cryptographic protocols, which are critical in ensuring the security
          of existing and emerging schemes. Left to resume pursuing interests in
          Machine Learning.
