          I wrote my undergraduate Senior Thesis paper "Exploring the
          Limitations of t-SNE" under the supervision of Professor Shuyang Ling
          of NYU Shanghai. The paper experimentally analyzed 3 problems using
          the t-SNE algorithm to test both its limitations and possible novel
          applications. The paper explored the effects of the "crowding problem"
          when embedding high-dimensional data in 2D, the preservation of latent
          geometric structure in embeddings, and the application of unscrambling
          the "Scrambled Radon Transform" in tomography data. As much as I
          regret it, while the paper was theoretically motivated, there was not
          a rigious analysis of the phenomenon, but rather just empirical
          studies.

          I received funding through the Deans' Undergraduate Research Fund at
          NYU Shanghai, where I conducted research under the supervision of
          Shuyang Ling. In the manuscript "Graph Embedding and Visualization
          Using t-SNE", I furthered some of the research I did as part of my
          Thesis and explored the application of t-SNE to graph embedding and
          visualization. In the paper, I studied applying t-SNE for use in graph
          embeddings. I primarily looked at 3 datasets: Facebook's "Egonet"
          dataset, the "JAGMESH" mesh network dataset, and a simple "Stochastic
          Block Model" network. While t-SNE possesses the ability to be able to
          perform graph embeddings, one of its limitations is the computational
          complexity required to compute it. There were 3 approaches that were
          taken to overcome this limitation: graph sparsification via "effective
          resistance" approximations, geodesic distance approximations via the
          Nystrom Approximation, and graph coarsening via Kron Reduction. While
          Kron Reduction was viable in some sense for reducing the computational
          complexity of the problem, given that we wanted to preserve all of the
          nodes in the original data in our embedding, I did not include results
          using the Kron Reduction as graph coarsening (removing/combining graph
          nodes) was not in the spirit of the paper's objective.

          Personally, I'm not sure that anyone should read this paper. It was
          from a period of my life when I was naive about research, and it was
          published long after it was written. Not only was I a naive young
          aspiring researcher, but the study of adversarial examples was young
          at the time as well. While I haven't studied this area for a while, if
          you are curious about adversarial examples, then you might want to
          read the paper
